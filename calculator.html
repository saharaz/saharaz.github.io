 <h3>This is a calculator Marcus and I made. Our first step was to design and create the buttons. After we had made all of our buttons, we looked at different calculator programs other people made to see how we can make each function work. While researching, we had discovered lambda and parser. After some explanation from Mr. Landfried as to what lambda and parser is, we began to program each button to do math. 
 To do that, we used the function get_variable() and get_operation(). Once that was finished, we decided to add some color to our calculator. Our last step was to create a "Save" and "Open" file. We were originally going to use the coding from playground, but for some reason it wasn't working. We then turned to our trusty friend google and found some code that allowed a user to save a file. We decided to use that code.
 Creating an open file was a lot harder. However, later on we discovered that we could use our save code, if we made a couple of adjustments. And that is how we have our current calculator.</h3>
